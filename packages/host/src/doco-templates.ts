/**
 * Default Doco templates (ADR-082; v7 reshape per
 * decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).
 *
 * The framework ships curated templates. `global` is the policies
 * template; the others describe common Doco shapes such as business
 * processes, glossaries, org charts, and decision-record collections.
 * Template names are plain handles.
 *
 * Each template ships:
 * - `description` — the description text rendered in the picker and
 *   bootstrap manifest.
 * - `policies` — at install time each entry seeds one row in the unified
 *   `policies` table. A standalone `kind` is *derived* from the entry by
 *   `templatePolicyToPolicyRow` (see host.ts): a prose-only entry
 *   becomes a `suggestion`; a probabilistic predicate becomes a
 *   `probabilistic` policy carrying its spec as the `agent_instruction`;
 *   any other predicate becomes a `deterministic` policy keyed by
 *   `sub_kind`. Template entries never carry a `kind` of their own.
 * - `allowedNodeTypes` (optional) — a Doco-level allowlist. `global`
 *   ships with policy types so the Doco's policy set is kept
 *   separate from domain Rule nodes.
 *
 * The historical Rule.kind overloading (guidance / authoring / tagged) is
 * gone — meta-constraints are policies, not Rule nodes
 * (decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG) — and the former
 * guidance_policies / node_authoring_policies split has collapsed into the
 * single `policies` table classified by the standalone `kind` (#909).
