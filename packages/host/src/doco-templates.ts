/**
 * Default Doco templates (ADR-082; v7 reshape per
 * decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).
 *
 * The framework ships curated templates. `global` is the policies
 * template; the others describe common Doco shapes such as business
 * processes, glossaries, and org charts. Per the successor to
 * decision_01KRFG5BAJ1ATHX0QE0HHX0QEV (which trimmed thirteen
 * templates down to two) — every other previously-shipped template
 * stays project-owner-authored. Template names are plain handles.
 *
 * Each template ships:
 * - `description` — the description text rendered in the picker and
 *   bootstrap manifest.
 * - `policies` — at install time entries seed Doco-level
 *   policies: prose-only entries become guidance_policies;
 *   predicate-bearing entries become node_authoring_policies.
 * - `allowedNodeTypes` (optional) — a Doco-level allowlist. `global`
 *   ships with policy types so the Doco's policy set is kept
 *   separate from domain Rule nodes.
 *
 * v7 (decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG) drops the
 * `kind: "authoring"` value from RuleKind. Templates no longer mark
 * policies "authoring" explicitly. Templates now store those
 * meta-constraints as policies instead of overloading
 * Rule.
