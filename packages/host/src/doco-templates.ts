/**
 * Default Doco templates (ADR-082; v7 reshape per
 * decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).
 *
 * The framework ships curated templates describing common Doco shapes
 * such as business processes and synced GitHub pull requests. Template
 * names are plain handles.
 *
 * Each template ships:
 * - `description` — the description text rendered in the picker and
 *   bootstrap manifest.
 * - `policies` — at install time each entry seeds one row in the unified
 *   `policies` table, classified by a standalone `kind` (translated in
 *   host.ts): a prose-only entry becomes a `suggestion` (advisory; the
 *   prose IS the agent instruction); an entry with a `probabilistic`
 *   predicate becomes a `probabilistic` policy (LLM-judged; the `spec` is
 *   the agent instruction); a `descriptive` predicate folds into a
 *   `suggestion` (recorded, not enforced); any other predicate becomes a
 *   `deterministic` policy (engine-checked, keyed by `sub_kind`).
 *
 * The historical guidance_policies / node_authoring_policies split — and
 * the older Rule.kind overloading (guidance / authoring / tagged) — are
 * both gone: every policy now lives in the one `policies` table, and
 * meta-constraints are policies, not Rule nodes
 * (decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).

 * Rationale (the `queued` stage): the node lifecycle is now
 * `drafting → queued → active → retired`. A node an author has explicitly
 * `queue`d is asserting it is ready to go live, so it must already satisfy
 * the same actor attribution (an `attributed_to` edge to a Principal), the
 * process it belongs to (a `has_parent` edge to its process Action), and
 * forward `flows_to` wiring an `active` node does — otherwise "ready" is a lie
 * the BPMN renderer can't draw. Only a `drafting` sketch may be incomplete.
 *
 * This is scoped to process on purpose: it is the one template
 * that defaults new nodes to `drafting` and carries a real
 * draft → queue → activate authoring story. A template that defaults new
 * nodes straight to `active` would rarely pass through `queued`, and would
 * fire its gates on `["active"]` instead.
 *
 * This covers BOTH the completeness/shape gates and the flow-node
 * Principal-attachment gates (an Action is `performed_by`, a gateway Decision
 * `decided_by` a Principal). All of them fire on the committed stages only, so
 * a `drafting` sketch may be both incomplete AND unowned while the author
 * iterates — and is held to the full bar once it is committed. (`retired` is
 * excluded too: a winding-down node isn't re-judged, and the runner's
 * terminal-skip drops these `requires_edge` checks anyway.)
