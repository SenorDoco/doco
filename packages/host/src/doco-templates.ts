/**
 * Default scope templates (ADR-082; v7 reshape per
 * decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).
 *
 * The framework ships five curated scopes. Two are auto-installed on
 * every new Doco (flagged `auto_install: true`): `#global` (the
 * Constitution) and `#important` (catch-all for important Doco-wide
 * decisions that don't fit a topical scope). The other three are
 * opt-in: `#user-flows` (opt-in at create time), `#state-machines`
 * (opt-in via `doco install-template #state-machines`), and
 * `#business-processes` (opt-in via `doco install-template
 * #business-processes`). Per the successor to
 * decision_01KRFG5BAJ1ATHX0QE0HHX0QEV (which trimmed thirteen
 * templates down to two) — every other previously-shipped template
 * stays project-owner-authored. All scope names are hashtag-shaped —
 * the leading `#` is part of the canonical name on every surface.
 *
 * Each template ships:
 * - `purpose` — the description text rendered under the scope name on
 *   every surface (list card, detail page, bootstrap manifest). Written
 *   directly onto the Scope row's `purpose` column at install time.
 * - `rules` — legacy template field name. At install time entries seed
 *   constitution articles: prose-only entries become guidance_articles;
 *   predicate-bearing entries become node_authoring_articles.
 * - `allowed_node_types` (optional) — a generic scope attribute that
 *   restricts which node types can be tagged into the scope. #global
 *   ships with constitution article types so the doco's constitution is
 *   kept separate from domain Rule nodes.
 *
 * v7 (decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG) drops the
 * `kind: "authoring"` value from RuleKind. Templates no longer mark
 * rules "authoring" explicitly. This branch now stores those meta-rules
 * as Constitution Articles instead of overloading Rule.
