/**
 * Default Doco templates (ADR-082; v7 reshape per
 * decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).
 *
 * The framework ships curated templates describing common Doco shapes
 * such as business processes, glossaries, org charts, and decision-record
 * collections. Template names are plain handles.
 *
 * Each template ships:
 * - `description` — the description text rendered in the picker and
 *   bootstrap manifest.
 * - `policies` — at install time each entry seeds one row in the unified
 *   `policies` table, classified by a standalone `kind` (translated in
 *   host.ts): a prose-only entry becomes a `suggestion` (advisory; the
 *   prose IS the agent instruction); an entry with a `probabilistic`
 *   predicate becomes a `probabilistic` policy (LLM-judged; the `spec` is
 *   the agent instruction); a `descriptive` predicate folds into a
 *   `suggestion` (recorded, not enforced); any other predicate becomes a
 *   `deterministic` policy (engine-checked, keyed by `sub_kind`).
 *
 * The historical guidance_policies / node_authoring_policies split — and
 * the older Rule.kind overloading (guidance / authoring / tagged) — are
 * both gone: every policy now lives in the one `policies` table, and
 * meta-constraints are policies, not Rule nodes
 * (decision_01KRRR5BQ16ASY8HQEE0V499YG).

 * Process fires its completeness + shape policies on the two

 *
 * Rationale (the `queued` stage): the node lifecycle is now
 * `drafting → queued → active → retired`. A node an author has explicitly
 * `queue`d is asserting it is ready to go live, so it must already satisfy
 * the same actor attribution (an `attributed_to` edge to a Principal), the
 * process it belongs to (a `has_parent` edge to its process Action), and
 * forward `flows_to` wiring an `active` node does — otherwise "ready" is a lie
 * the BPMN renderer can't draw. Only a `drafting` sketch may be incomplete.
 *
 * This is scoped to process on purpose: it is the one template
 * that defaults new nodes to `drafting` and carries a real
 * draft → queue → activate authoring story. Templates that default new
 * nodes straight to `active` (decision-records, glossaries, org-chart)
 * rarely pass through `queued`, so they still fire on `["active"]`.
 *
 * This covers BOTH the completeness/shape gates and the flow-node
 * Principal-attachment gates (an Action is `performed_by`, a gateway Decision
 * `decided_by` a Principal). All of them fire on the committed stages only, so
 * a `drafting` sketch may be both incomplete AND unowned while the author
 * iterates — and is held to the full bar once it is committed. (`retired` is
 * excluded too: a winding-down node isn't re-judged, and the runner's
 * terminal-skip drops these `requires_edge` checks anyway.)

    // attribute**, off the prose. Keeping the definition out of the prose
    // matters because a node's name is the first line of its prose
    // everywhere in Doco (List, Graph, search, the node dialog, and the
    // Glossary headword all derive from it): if the definition were the
    // prose, the definition would become the term's name. So the prose holds
    // only the term, and the meaning sits in `definition`. `alternatives`
    // carries aliases / rejected labels.
    //
    // Why a Reference (not a Decision)? A glossary term is a stable
    // reference to a named thing, not a choice between alternatives with a
    // rationale — that is the shape of a Reference, and it is also the node
    // a glossary already uses to cite an external source. So a single node
    // type covers both a defined term and the sources it derives from: a
    // term entry is a Reference with a `definition`, a cited source is a
    // Reference with a `locator`.
    //
    // Two stages, on purpose. A glossary is a reference work, so a term
    // entry is either the canonical answer (`active`) or a deprecated one
    // kept for lookup (`retired`) — exactly the two stages a policy uses.
    // The framework's other lifecycle stages add nothing here: `queued`
    // (provisional-but-ready, e.g. an open PR awaiting approval) has no
    // glossary meaning — a term is either the canonical answer or it isn't —
    // and `drafting` is just a private scratch state for an unfinished term,
    // not part of the glossary yet. So a captured term lands `active` (no
    // `defaultNodeLifecycle` override) and the completeness gates fire on
    // `active`; a `drafting` stub is exempt until it is activated, and a
    // `retired` term winds down without re-running the gates. (Contrast
    // process, which defaults to `drafting` so a flow can be
    // wired up incrementally.)
    //
    // Term relationships are first-class edges: `relates_to` is the
    // associative "see also" link (confusable, broader/narrower, or
    // homograph terms); `replaces` links a retired term to its replacement;
    // `derived_from` cites the external source a borrowed term comes from;
    // and an Eval `supports` the term it checks.
    //
    // The dictionary-styled Glossary perspective is the natural reading
    // surface for terminology, so a Doco created from this template opens

(d) ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS: only inspect the headword in the prose. If the headword is itself an acronym or abbreviation, PASS when the `definition` expands it at least once and states whether the short form is acceptable in product/docs/UI copy; FAIL when it is left unexpanded.
