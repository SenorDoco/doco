/**
 * Ten real-life decision-record scenarios, run through the *real* authoring
 * evaluator.
 *
 * These are not shape assertions on the template literal — they seed each
 * template's policies through the same `templatePolicyToSeededPolicy` bridge
 * the host uses at Doco-creation time, then drive `evaluatePolicies` (the
 * production engine) against realistic candidate Decisions across the four
 * decision-record domains and every lifecycle stage.
 *
 * What this proves about the post-`queued` architecture:
 *   - `drafting` is an unjudged scratchpad (sketch freely, `chosen` may be
 *     blank);
 *   - the completeness / uniqueness / quality / membership gates begin the
 *     moment a record is *proposed* (`queued`) and keep holding once it is
 *     *accepted* (`active`), so review happens before acceptance;
 *   - `retired` winds a record down without re-tripping shape gates;
 *   - the node-type allowlist is a structural invariant that fires at every
 *     stage.
 *
 * The two LLM-judged gates (domain membership + ADR-style quality) cannot run
 * a real model in CI, so the engine emits them as `pending` probabilistic
 * violations carrying the `agent_instruction` an LLM judge would resolve.
 * Each scenario asserts that the right judge *fires* (or stays silent) for the
 * candidate's type and stage; the verdict a real judge would return is noted
 * inline and exercised against production in the PR's verification report.
